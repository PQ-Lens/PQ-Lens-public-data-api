# PQ-Lens Court Order Sample Dataset API

A lightweight Flask API for read-only public access to **dataset metadata** and **text records** for court-order related NLP workflows.

This project is designed as a small, local-first service that stores data in a JSON file and exposes endpoints for:

- read-only dataset metadata retrieval
- read-only record retrieval with filtering and cursor pagination
- deterministic shuffled sampling
- non-mutating split generation for evaluation/dev/test workflows

## Architecture at a glance

The application is implemented in `app.py` and built around:

1. **Flask app factory (`create_app`)**
2. **`DataStore` abstraction** for JSON-file persistence
3. **Validation helpers** for datasets, records, and query/body parameters
4. **Public read-only REST endpoints** under `/datasets` and nested record routes

Data is persisted to `data_store.json` by default (created automatically at runtime if absent).

---

## Dataset scope and curation

This repository contains a **curated sample corpus of publicly available legal/court-order data** collected from multiple public-domain or publicly accessible sources.

Key characteristics of the corpus:

- **Cross-source curation**: documents are aggregated from different public sources rather than a single publisher.
- **Language distribution**: the dataset is weighted toward **Maltese-English paired content** and **Maltese-only content**, while also including **English-only records**.
- **Translation relevance**: because many entries are bilingual or translation-adjacent, the corpus is well suited for building and evaluating **Maltese ↔ English translation models**.

Recommended use cases:

- machine translation (MT) fine-tuning for Maltese-English
- bilingual alignment experiments
- terminology extraction and domain adaptation for legal text

> Note: suitability for production ML depends on your own quality checks (deduplication, licensing review, alignment verification, and train/dev/test protocol design).

## Data model

### Dataset object

A dataset represents a logical collection of records.

```json
{
  "id": "court_orders",
  "summary": "Court order metadata.",
  "description": "Optional long description",
  "language_mode": "bilingual_aligned",
  "synthetic_status": "non_synthetic",
  "synthetic_details": {},
  "provenance": {
    "source_url": "https://example.com/public-registry",
    "source_type": "web"
  },
  "created_at": "2026-01-01T10:00:00+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-01-01T10:00:00+00:00"
}
```

### Record object

A record belongs to exactly one dataset.

```json
{
  "id": "r1",
  "dataset_id": "court_orders",
  "text": "Sample text",
  "language": "eng_Latn",
  "language_pair": null,
  "synthetic_status": "unknown",
  "translation_metadata": {},
  "provenance": {
    "source_text": "OCR process from archive",
    "source_type": "ocr_archive"
  },
  "attributes": {},
  "created_at": "2026-01-01T10:00:00+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-01-01T10:00:00+00:00"
}
```

### Provenance object

Provenance is mandatory for datasets and records and must include at least one of:

- `source_url`
- `source_text`

Optional:

- `source_type` (enumerated values below)

---

## Validation rules

### Enumerated values

- `language_mode`:
  - `monolingual`
  - `bilingual_aligned`
  - `multilingual`

- `synthetic_status`:
  - `non_synthetic`
  - `partly_synthetic`
  - `fully_synthetic`
  - `unknown`

- `source_type`:
  - `web`
  - `api`
  - `file`
  - `ocr_archive`
  - `manual_entry`
  - `other`

### Language format

Record `language` must match NLLB tag format like `eng_Latn` or `mlt_Latn`.

### OCR-specific rule

When `provenance.source_type == "ocr_archive"`, `provenance.source_text` is required.

### Query parameter checks

- `batch_size`: positive integer (`1..10000`)
- `cursor`: non-negative integer (`0..10000000`)
- `seed`: optional integer
- `order`: `natural` or `shuffle`

---

## Storage model

The API stores state in a JSON file with this shape:

```json
{
  "datasets": {
    "<dataset_id>": { "...dataset object...": "..." }
  },
  "records": {
    "<dataset_id>": {
      "<record_id>": { "...record object...": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

Persistence uses atomic write semantics via temporary file replacement.

## API reference

## Health and metadata

### `GET /health`
Returns service liveness.

### `GET /languages`
Returns currently advertised language codes.

---

## Dataset endpoints

The public API exposes dataset retrieval only. Dataset create, update, and delete routes are not implemented so public users cannot alter the corpus through the API.

### `GET /datasets`
List all datasets.

### `GET /datasets/<dataset_id>`
Get one dataset.

---

## Record endpoints

The public API exposes record retrieval only. Record create, update, and delete routes are not implemented so public users cannot alter dataset contents through the API.

### `GET /datasets/<dataset_id>/records`
List records with optional filtering, ordering, and cursor pagination.

Query params:

- `order`: `natural` (default) or `shuffle`
- `seed`: integer (used only with `order=shuffle` for reproducibility)
- `batch_size`: integer, default `100`
- `cursor`: integer offset, default `0`
- `language`: exact language filter
- `synthetic_status`: exact synthetic status filter

Response includes:

- `total_records`
- `batch_size`
- `cursor`
- `next_cursor` (or `null` when exhausted)
- `order`
- `seed`
- `data` (current batch)

### `GET /datasets/<dataset_id>/records/<record_id>`
Fetch one record.

---

## Split sampling endpoint

### `POST /datasets/<dataset_id>/splits/sample`
Build named split batches from dataset records without modifying stored data. This endpoint accepts `POST` because split definitions are supplied in the request body, but it is retrieval-only and does not create, update, or delete datasets or records.

Request body:

- `splits` (required): object mapping split names to sizes
  - example: `{ "dev": 100, "test": 100, "eval": 50 }`
- `order` (optional): `natural` or `shuffle` (default: `shuffle`)
- `seed` (optional): integer seed for deterministic shuffle
- `disjoint` (optional): boolean (default: `true`)
- `filters` (optional):
  - `language`
  - `synthetic_status`

Behavior:

- If `disjoint=true`, records are consumed split-by-split without overlap.
- If `disjoint=false`, each split is taken independently from the start of the same filtered list.

---

## Internal data import

The public API does not provide create, update, or delete endpoints. Use `scripts/import_bilingual_xlsx.py` as an offline/internal data-preparation tool that writes the JSON store directly before the public API is started.

```bash
python scripts/import_bilingual_xlsx.py \
  --xlsx bilingual.xlsx \
  --store-path data_store.json
```

The importer creates or updates the `court_orders_bilingual` dataset in the JSON store using this metadata:

- **Summary**: A bilingual legal-text dataset derived from Court Notices published on the Government of Malta website. It contains parallel Maltese–English text pairs extracted from court notice PDFs and converted into structured text format.
- **Description**: This dataset contains Court Notices from the Government of Malta website (gov.mt). It contains Maltese–English pairs for each court notice. The original dataset format was PDF text; these extracts have been converted into structured text pairs in both Maltese and English. The dataset contains 2,310 rows of data. The latest record date is 7 May 2026, and the earliest record date is 22 November 2022. The dataset is suitable for Maltese–English and English–Maltese machine translation tasks, legal NLP research tasks, and bilingual legal language analysis.
- **Language mode**: `bilingual_aligned`
- **Synthetic status**: `non_synthetic`
- **Source language**: `eng_Latn`
- **Target language**: `mlt_Latn`
- **Language pair**: `eng_Latn-mlt_Latn`

For each worksheet row, the importer stores the English text in the record `text` field and the Maltese text in `translation_metadata.target_text`. It treats existing records as already imported, making repeated runs safe. After writing `data_store.json`, it verifies that every expected row exists with the required language, language-pair, provenance, translation, and row-number metadata.

## Examples

### 1) List datasets

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/datasets"
```

### 2) Fetch one dataset

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/datasets/court_orders"
```

### 3) List records with deterministic shuffling

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/datasets/court_orders/records?order=shuffle&seed=42&batch_size=25"
```

### 4) Sample disjoint splits

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/datasets/court_orders/splits/sample" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "splits": {"dev": 3, "test": 3, "eval": 2},
    "order": "shuffle",
    "seed": 12,
    "disjoint": true
  }'
```

---

## Error handling

Errors are returned as JSON with a predictable structure:

```json
{
  "error": "human-readable message",
  "details": {},
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T10:00:00+00:00"
}
```

Common status codes:

- `400` invalid input
- `404` not found
- `405` method not allowed for non-implemented mutation methods on public routes
- `500` unexpected server error

---

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m unittest -v
```

Current tests validate:

- public dataset and record mutation routes are not implemented
- natural ordering defaults
- shuffle reproducibility with seed
- disjoint split behavior

---

## Repository notes

- PDF and other source artifacts in this repository represent a curated, publicly available legal-text corpus with strong Maltese-English relevance; however, the Flask API runtime persistence path is JSON-based (`data_store.json`) and not Excel-backed.
- To use another storage location (for tests/environments), pass `DATA_STORE_PATH` via `create_app({...})`.
